A F#m x 2
First time I came over
I was bitten by your dog
You weren't even there 
cuz you were walking in the fog

D               
I called you up and plead and beg
Bm
and talk to your machine
D
My friends say not to bother
E
when you're actin' pretty mean

A F#m   x 2
But I don't mean to bother you
no I won't play that part
I just want access
to the inside of your heart

D
Access to your thoughts
Bm
on the way that I should be
D
So I can start to change
E
And maybe you can Access Me

Access me, access me

You could tell me all about all the things you did at work
The guy who sits beside you and how he's acting like a jerk
And you don't have to open up the secrets of your soul
But if that's the place you want me I'd be glad to pay the toll

But I don't need to bother you, no I won't play that part
I just want access to the inside of your heart
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me

Access me


Basically it just switches between the major keys and the minor keys.
Same notes, different key.  Also, they're not playing straight chords.  
The song is driven by the bass (I think it's a Mike song) and Trey is 
just sort accompanying it with the spacy guitar sounds he usually 
reserves for jams.


Standard disclaimer: This is all my own work
