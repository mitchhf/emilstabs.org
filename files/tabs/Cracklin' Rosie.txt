(Song by Neil Diamond)
O.k., so I went out and found _Neil Diamond's 12 Greatest Hits_. Not a
bad album, by a long stretch, but it leads me to a question for all the
guitarists out there.  What do you think the chords are?  From listening
to the recording, I've determined that it's based around the  I-IV-V
progression, and it starts on D.  something like (using the words from
the lyric file):

Strum: Agressive on 1, muted on 2, agressive on 3, muted on 4

D
Cracklin Rosie get on board,
D                                            G
We're gonna ride 'til there ain't no more to go.
G
Takin it slow.  Lord don't you know,
Em                      A                 D  <--what goes on this line?
Happily a time when the poor man's let be...
repeat
D     G             D                  G      A       D
Oh, I love my Rosie child, you got the way to make me happy.
D       G      A     D
You and me, we go in style.
Em
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store-bought woman,
Em
You make me sing like a guitar hummin.
Em                                          A
Hang on to me, girl, our song keeps runnin' on.

--we all know the chords here....;-)--  
A muted stop, A A A
Play it now, Play it now, Play it now my lady!

then it just keeps going, and the key change after the second
"Play it now!" just raises everything a half-step.
thanks, and to anyone who hasn't heard the original version,
go to your library and check out the album!!!!

Hitchin' on a twilight train,

G
We got all night,

A                                D
Find us a dream and don't ask no questions Yea!
